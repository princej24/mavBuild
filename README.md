# mavBuild


Talk about the language you choose, why, and what you decide to try to build with it
Tell us about your project. Your grade will not necessarily be based on "completeness".
Talk about your experiences while learning to use it. Where did you run into headaches? What did you do to solve problems
Give honest opinions about the languages and things you learn.
